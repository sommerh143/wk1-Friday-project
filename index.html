            <h3>My Background</h3>
          </div>
          <p>I don't have much experience with coding, i took a few classes through pcc, that's about is. I decided to enroll in epicodus because the classes i did take through pcc intrigued me and I wanted to learn more! I plan on putting all my focus on epicodus and learning as much as I can to be successful in my future.</p>
